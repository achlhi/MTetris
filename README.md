A Tetris Clone for Android based on Tetris: The Grand Master. Developed for the final assignment of my second-year Mobile Application Development class. Pretty much my first foray into the Android world.

The Arika system is quite different from the standard system (known as "World Rules" or similar in some games). See the [Tetris Concept Wiki](http://tetrisconcept.net/wiki/Tetris_The_Grand_Master) entry for more information, or [Kitaru's Tetris: The Grandmaster guide](http://kitaru.1101b.com/TGMGUIDE/). I did my best to mimic the mechanics as closely as possible.
